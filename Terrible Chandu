Chandu is a bad student. Once his teacher asked him to print the reverse of a given string. He took three hours to solve it. The teacher got agitated at Chandu and asked you the same question. Can you solve it?

Input:
The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case contains a string S, comprising of only lower case letters.

Output:
For each test case, print the reverse of the string S.

Constraints:

1 <= T <= 10
1 <= |S| <= 30

Solution:

/* IMPORTANT: class must not be public. */

/*
 * uncomment this if you want to read input.
 */
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;


class TestClass {
    public static void main(String args[] ) throws Exception {
        /*
         * Read input from stdin and provide input before running
*/
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        String line = br.readLine();
        int T = Integer.parseInt(line);
        for (int k = 0; k < T; k++) {
           String s = br.readLine();
           
           String reverse="";
		
		for(int i=s.length()-1;i>=0;i--)
		{
			reverse = reverse + s.charAt(i);	
		}
           System.out.println(reverse);
        }
    }
}
